I have worked on various Python projects and hence decided to group them together into a repository for ease of access and to be able to track my progress.
Each project has a specific functionality and a motivation behind it for making it.
## Applications currently present in PyJects :
* Jarvis: AI Desktop Voice Assistant

Have you ever wondered how cool it would be to have your own A.I. assistant? Imagine how easier it would be to send emails without typing a single word, doing Wikipedia searches without opening web browsers, and performing many other daily tasks like playing music with the help of a single voice command. In this program, I have created a personal A.I. assistant using Python. 

* Flappy Bird Game

Flappy Bird is an arcade-style game in which the player controls the bird Faby, which moves persistently to the right. The player is tasked with navigating Faby through pairs of pipes that have equally sized gaps placed at random heights. Faby automatically descends and only ascends when the player taps the screen. Each successful pass through a pair of pipes awards the player one point. Colliding with a pipe or the ground ends the gameplay.

* Decision Review System

The Umpire Decision Review System (UDRS or simply DRS) is a technology-based system used in cricket to assist the match officials with their decision-making.
